# Introduction:

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Java programs, ranging from core concepts like **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to advanced topics like **Multithreading** and **Exception Handling**.
It is primarily used as a coding practice portfolio, demonstrating proficiency in clean code practices and the fundamental building blocks of the Java language.


# Key Topics and Code Examples:

The repository is organized into distinct folders, each focusing on a core area of Java development.

| **Abstraction** | Principles of Abstraction, Interfaces, and Abstract Classes.

| **Advanced-Java** | Complex Java features and techniques.

| **MultiThreading** | Thread creation, synchronization, and concurrency.

| **Exception-Handling** | Custom and built-in Exception handling techniques .

| **Java-Strings** | String manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving.

| **Recursion** | Implementing recursive algorithms for efficiency.

| **Covariant** | Use of Covariant Return Types in method overriding.

| **Java-Batch-R** | Contains a mixture of DSA, OOP, assignments, and topics like interfaces, abstract && super && static keywords, getter & setter and method chaining.

| **Java-Patterns** | Design patterns or code structure examples.

| **anonymous** | Usage of Anonymous Inner Classes.
